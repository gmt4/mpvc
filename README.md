## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Overview [^install]

[mpvc](../../) is a collection of POSIX shell scripts:

- [mpvc](../../blob/master/mpvc): provides the core CLI commands to control mpv
- [extras/mpvc-tui](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-tui): provides a console TUI, using mpvc underneath
- [extras/mpvc-fzf](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-fzf): provides FZF integration to mpvc.
- [extras/mpvc-web](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-web): a hack to remotely control mpvc from web (handy on mobile)
- [extras/mpvc-mpris](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-mpris): speaks MPRIS to control mpv player through key-bindings.
- [extras/mpvc-equalizer](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-equalizer): provides a basic mpv equalizer for the CLI.
- [extras/mpvc-autostart](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-autostart): automatic mpv start/stop based on presence.
- [extras/mpvc-installer](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-installer): provides an installer to install/update mpvc.

For more details on how to use the above tools have a look at the [Git](#git) QuickStart Guide, [LogBook](../../wiki#logbook).
In addition, the [casts/](../../wiki#screencasts) directory to shows some screencasts of mpvc in action.

## Requirements

Required:

- `mpv`
- `socat`: is preferred due to the differing implementations of `netcat` across UNIXes.
- `awk`: a sane version of `awk` for the same reason (`gawk` works)

Recommended extras:

- `curl`
- `fzf`
- `jq`
- `notify-send`
- `yt-dlp`

## Installation

- [Manual](#manual)
- [Git](#git)
- [Debian](#debian)
- [Arch](#arch-mpvc-git)
- [BSD](#bsd)
- [MacOS](#macos)
- [Gentoo](#gentoo-mpvc)
- [Nix](#nix-mpvc)

Installing is just a matter of fetching the scripts either via [Git](#git)/Curl/etc., scripts can be used directly from the repo, the `mpvc-installer` bit is just there for easiness, to fetch & link them into your `BINDIR=~/bin/` that [mpvc-installer](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-installer) does by default. 

The easiest for a onetime install is the [Manual](#manual), however for @latest version a [Git](#git) install is recommended.
Check for missing dependencies/requirements using `mpvc-installer check-reqs`.

### Manual

```console
curl -fsSL -O https://github.com/lwilletts/mpvc/raw/master/extras/mpvc-installer \
  && BINDIR=$HOME/bin sh ./mpvc-installer fetch-user
```

### Git

Below is a **Quick Start** guide showcasing mpvc git install and usage.
This does git clone, and symlinks the mpvc scripts to `BINDIR` (default `~/bin`), so updating becomes a matter of just running `git pull`.

```sh
 # fetch a local copy of the github repo
 git clone https://github.com/lwilletts/mpvc/
 # use extras/mpvc-installer: just copy/link to BINDIR=$HOME/bin (by default)
 (cd mpvc; extras/mpvc-installer link-user)
 (cd mpvc; extras/mpvc-installer check-reqs)

 # use mpvc-fzf to search and play youtube media
 mpvc-fzf -p 'kupla mirage'
 # use mpvc to add/load/save media files or online YT URLs
 mpvc add /path/to/your/*.mp3 # or your URLs
 find . -type f -name | mpvc load
 mpvc save my-playlist

 # use mpvc stash to store/recover current mpv state (see the logbook for more)
 mpvc stash ls
 mpvc stash push current
 mpvc stash apply current

 # use mpvc-fzf to manage the playlist
 mpvc-fzf -f
 # use mpvc-tui to start the tui + desktop notifications
 mpvc-tui -T
```

For more  check the  [LogBook](../../wiki#logbook) (remeber your best chance is to try, play, and have fun).

## Limitations

Like any piece of software, mpvc is not perfect:
- mpvc does not resolve individual files in a directory unless it is
  currently in or has been inside that directory, giving misleading results about
  the total number of files in the current playlist. This is a limitation of mpv.
- mpvc depends on shell tools. If your shell is misconfigured or you are using
  unusual variants of basic UNIX tools, mpvc is not guaranteed to work. However,
  all effort has been made to make mpvc as POSIX compliant as possible.
  Remember to check for missing dependencies/requirements using `mpvc-installer check-reqs`.
