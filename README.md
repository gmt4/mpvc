# mpvc üéß

A terminal music player in POSIX sh(1) that interfaces mpv providing mpc(1) commands + extras.
This forks [lwillets/mpvc](https://github.com/lwilletts/mpvc) providing some extra goodies such as: improved CLI, TUI, FZF, WEB, EQ, & playing media from YouTube & streaming services.
Check the [Wiki](../../wiki), [LogBook](https://gmt4.github.io/mpvc/logbook.html) & [Casts](https://gmt4.github.io/mpvc/casts/) for a detailed view of the extra features of this fork.

## Overview

[mpvc](https://github.com/gmt4/mpvc/) player functionality is provided by:

- [mpvc](../../blob/master/mpvc): provides the mpvc player core CLI commands
- [extras/mpvc-tui](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-tui): provides a console TUI, using mpvc underneath
- [extras/mpvc-fzf](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-fzf): provides FZF integration to mpvc.
- [extras/mpvc-web](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-web): a hack to remotely control mpvc from web (handy on mobile)
- [extras/mpvc-mpris](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-mpris): speaks MPRIS to control mpv player through key-bindings.
- [extras/mpvc-equalizer](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-equalizer): provides a basic mpv equalizer for the CLI.
- [extras/mpvc-autostart](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-autostart): automatic mpv start/stop based on presence.
- [extras/mpvc-installer](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-installer): provides an installer to install/update mpvc.

For more details on how to use the above tools have a look at the [logbok.html](https://gmt4.github.io/mpvc/logbook.html).
In addition, the [casts/](https://gmt4.github.io/mpvc/casts/) directory to shows some screencasts of mpvc in action.

## Installation

To install mpvc, the easiest is the curl based install below, otherwise choose what better suits you:

- curl based install: as in [QuickInstall](#quickinstall-%EF%B8%8F).
- git based install: as in [QuickStart](#quickstart).
- distro package based installation:
  - Arch Linux package: `pacaur -y mpvc-git` [mpvc-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mpvc-git)
  - Gentoo Linux package: `emerge mpvc` [mpvc](https://gitlab.com/xy2_/osman)
  - Nix package: `nix-env -i mpvc` [mpvc](http://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/tree/master/pkgs/applications/misc/mpvc)

### QuickInstall ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

[mpvc-installer](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-installer) fetch-user: installs mpvc under BINDIR=~/bin/

`curl -fsSL -o mpvc-installer https://github.com/gmt4/mpvc/raw/master/extras/mpvc-installer && sh ./mpvc-installer fetch-user`

### QuickStart

<pre>
 <b># fetch a local copy of the github repo</b>
 git clone https://github.com/gmt4/mpvc/
 <b># use extras/mpvc-installer: just copy/link to your $HOME/bin</b>
 (cd mpvc; extras/mpvc-installer link-user)

 <b># use mpvc-fzf to search and play youtube media</b>
 mpvc-fzf -p 'kupla mirage'
 <b># use mpvc to add/load/save media files or online YT URLs</b>
 mpvc add /path/to/your/*.mp3 # or your URLs
 find . -type f -name | mpvc load
 mpvc save my-playlist

 <b># use mpvc-fzf to manage the playlist</b>
 mpvc-fzf -f
 <b># use mpvc-tui to start the tui + desktop notifications</b>
 mpvc-tui -T
</pre>

### Dependencies

- Required:  `mpv`,  `socat`: is preferred due to the differing implementations of `netcat` across UNIXes, and, `awk`: a sane version of `awk` for the same reason (`gawk` works)
- Recommended extras: `curl` `fzf` `jq` `notify-send`

Check for missing dependencies using `mpvc-installer check-reqs`:

- Debian (and derivatives such as Ubuntu): `apt install mpv gawk curl socat fzf rlwrap jq libnotify-bin`
- Arch (and derivatives): `pacman -Sy mpv gawk curl socat fzf rlwrap jq libnotify`
- BSD (and pkg(1) based derivatives): `pkg install -y mpv gawk curl socat fzf rlwrap jq libnotify`
- MacOS (and brew(1) based derivatives see [FAQ](../../wiki/FAQ)): `brew install gawk socat fzf rlwrap jq gnu-sed yt-dlp # mpv curl libnotify`

## Useful Tricks

Some basic tricks are provided in [QuickStart](#quickstart). For more tips on loading/saving/maniputaling the mpv playlist/state, managing av/vf filters, etc. are provided in the [LogBook](https://gmt4.github.io/mpvc/logbook.html).

## Limitations

Like any piece of software, mpvc is not perfect:

- mpvc does not resolve individual files in a directory unless it is
  currently in or has been inside that directory, giving misleading results about
  the total number of files in the current playlist. This is a limitation of mpv.
- mpvc depends on shell tools. If your shell is misconfigured or you are using
  unusual variants of basic UNIX tools, mpvc is not guaranteed to work. However,
  all effort has been made to make mpvc as POSIX compliant as possible.
